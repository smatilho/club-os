# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Blueprint-stage releases are pre-1.0 and may change rapidly. Critical security fixes target the latest main branch first.

- Report privately to project maintainers with:
  - affected component(s)
  - impact summary
  - reproduction steps or proof of concept
  - suggested mitigation (if known)

## Response Targets
- Initial acknowledgement: within 72 hours.
- Triage and severity classification: within 7 days.
- Mitigation plan or fix timeline: as soon as severity is confirmed.

## Disclosure
- Coordinate disclosure timing with maintainers.
- Credit reporters when requested and appropriate.
