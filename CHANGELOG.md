### Phase 0 — Foundation
- `apps/web`: Next.js App Router with `/public`, `/member`, `/admin` route areas and per-area layouts.
- `services/api`: Hono-based modular monolith skeleton with module loader, health module, and request context.
- Platform abstraction ports: `DatabasePort`, `ObjectStoragePort`, `QueuePort`, `AuthClaimsPort`, `ObservabilityPort`.
- `packages/domain-core`: `Result<T,E>` type, branded IDs (`OrgId`, `UserId`, `MembershipId`).
- `packages/auth-rbac`: policy engine types and `evaluatePolicy` matching `policy-engine-contract.md`, `SessionContext`.
- `packages/module-registry`: full-schema `validateModuleManifest`, `ModuleRegistry` class.
- TypeScript typechecking enabled across all packages and services.
- Vitest unit tests for domain-core, auth-rbac, module-registry, and API health endpoint (28 tests).
- Web route map doc (`docs/architecture/web-route-map.md`).

### Phase 1 — Identity + RBAC + Organization
- `packages/domain-core`: `User`, `Membership`, `RoleAssignment` entities with branded IDs and `MembershipStatus`.
- `packages/auth-rbac`: RBAC seed role → capability mappings per RBAC matrix v1 (`ROLE_CAPABILITY_MAP`).
  - `resolveCapabilities(roles)` deduplicates capabilities from multiple assigned roles.
  - `AuditEntry` type and `AuditWriter` port interface for privileged action logging.
  - `InMemoryAuditWriter` for development and testing.
- `services/api`: Auth and policy middleware.
  - `authMiddleware`: production-safe bearer-token entrypoint (real token verification via `AuthClaimsPort` in later phase).
  - `mockAuthMiddleware`: separate local/test-only mock header session extraction with Bearer precedence over mock headers.
  - `requireCapability(cap, resourceType)`: policy-enforcing middleware using `evaluatePolicy`, writes audit entries.
  - `requireCapability(..., { extractResource })`: supports resource organization resolution so tenant-mismatch denies are policy-evaluated and audited centrally.
  - Identity module (`/api/identity/*`): organization read, membership CRUD, role assignment/removal.
  - Runtime request validation for identity membership/role payloads (rejects invalid role values and malformed JSON).
  - Tenant isolation enforced at service and policy middleware layers (with tenant-mismatch deny auditing).
- `apps/web`: Auth enforcement on route area layouts.
  - `/member/*` layout: redirects unauthenticated users to `/public`.
  - `/admin/*` layout: redirects users without management capability to `/member`, unauthenticated to `/public`.
  - Server-side `getSession()` reads mock session from cookie (UX guard only; API enforces authz).
- Web UI testing baseline:
  - `apps/web` now runs `Vitest + React Testing Library` (route pages/layout guards).
  - Root Playwright config + route-area auth-guard smoke specs (`pnpm test:web:e2e`).
  - GitHub Actions Playwright smoke job added (non-blocking rollout, uploads artifacts on failure).
- Tests: 100 total in `pnpm check` (7 web, 22 auth-rbac, 2 domain-core, 16 module-registry, 45 API, 8 CI guards).
  - RBAC seed mapping tests (11 tests across all 6 roles).
  - Audit writer tests (4 tests).
  - Auth middleware tests (5 tests).
  - Policy middleware tests (8 tests including audit logging).
  - Identity service tests (15 tests including tenant isolation).
  - Identity route tests (11 tests: auth, authz, audit logging, tenant role validation).
  - Web route/page tests (7 tests via Vitest + React Testing Library).

### Phase 2 — Content CMS + Public Area + Branding

    - `GET /api/content/public/pages/:slugPath`: unauthenticated, serves published snapshot only, supports nested slugs.
    - Publish copies current draft to published snapshot; post-publish draft edits do not affect public.
    - Slug uniqueness enforced per organization (draft collision rejection).
  - Org-profile module (`/api/org-profile/*`): tenant branding/theme storage.
    - `GET /api/org-profile/theme` (settings.read), `PUT /api/org-profile/theme` (settings.manage).

  - `POST /api/content/seed` — capability-gated admin endpoint for explicit seed triggering.
  - Auto-seeds on server startup for default org (dev/production), disabled in tests via `autoSeed: false`.
- `/public` homepage resolution: fetches CMS page with slug `home` instead of static placeholder. Onboarding fallback with admin dashboard link when no homepage exists.
- Playwright e2e tests: seeded homepage and nav discoverable without manual URL typing; webmaster workflow (create from template → publish → menu placement → verify in public nav).

  - Admin CRUD with `requireCapability` and `extractResource` for tenant-mismatch detection.
  - Content→menu integration on publish: `upsertForContentPage` / `removeForContentPage`.
  - Content API extended: `contentFormat`, `blocks`, `templateKey` on create; `blocks` on update; published snapshot includes blocks.
  - Template instantiation regenerates block IDs with `crypto.randomUUID()`.
- `apps/web`: Unified shells with menu-driven navigation.

  - `/admin/content`: content list with menu status column.
  - `/public/[...slug]`: block rendering for `blocks_v1` pages via `BlockRenderer`.
- UX-1D Visual System Pass:
  - Design tokens: added `shadows` (sm/md/lg/xl), `lineHeight` scale, `fontSize["5xl"]`, `fontWeight.extrabold`, `spacing["3xl"]`/`["4xl"]`, `adminTheme.surfaceRaised`/`borderHover`, expanded `publicThemeDefaults`.
  - Block renderers upgraded: gradient-driven hero/CTA, elevated cards with shadows, responsive auto-fill grids, numbered feature list, lead paragraph treatment, extrabold stats, FAQ as white cards on alt background.
  - Templates upgraded: richer block compositions (hero→stats→features→CTA), credible default copy, demo-ready out of box.
